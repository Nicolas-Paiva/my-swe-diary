Currently learning C. I am struggling with pointers right now. I understand what they do and what, but it is confusing to understand when to use them and how to use them properly. For now, i am trying to implement some basic functions using them.

As for other subjects, I am learning some "Computer Systems" which is related to the architecture of computers and how they work.

Linear Algebra is also another subject I am currently studying. Learning matrices for now

I could not really write here since the last time because my life is  a little busy right now. I have been studying mostly C (pointers are really hard to understand, but I am gonna understand it!), Computer Systems and Linear Algebra. I have not found material for Ethics and Multimedia Systems. As soon as I have some resources I will study them as well.

I could not really focus recently because of some problems... But I think things are finally getting better, and soon I will be able to study properly. I tried to understand "recursion" but it's a concept that I will need a long time to understand and be comfortable with
