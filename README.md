# My Software Engineer diary

Here I will describe everything I study and do in order to become a better software engineer. The goal is to look back and see how much I have improved...


#### Sep 07th, 2023:

Currently learning C. I am struggling with pointers right now. I understand what they do and what they are, but it is confusing to understand when to use them and how to use them properly. For now, i am trying to implement some basic functions using them...

As for other subjects, I am learning some "Computer Systems" which is related to the architecture of computers and how they work.

Linear Algebra is also another subject I am currently studying. Learning matrices for now.


#### Sep 12th, 2023:

I could not really write here since the last time because my life is  a little busy right now. I have been studying mostly C (pointers are really hard to understand, but I am gonna understand it!), Computer Systems and Linear Algebra. I have not found material for Ethics and Multimedia Systems. As soon as I have some resources I will study them as well...


#### Sep 21st, 2023:

I could not really focus recently because of some problems... But I think things are finally getting better, and soon I will be able to study properly. I tried to understand "recursion" but it's a concept that I will need a long time to understand and be comfortable with


#### Sep 24th, 2023:

Sadly I could not really study for the last 10 days or so. I need to work a little bit more, but in October things will get back to normal. Hopefully I will understand more about programming as well as linear algebra and computer systems


#### Sep 25th, 2023:

Getting back to my studies... Felt super sleepy today and could not study as much as I wanted, but ended up learning some linear algebra (determinants and their properties) and I am also starting to learn about file handling in C...


### Oct 17th, 2023:

After a while without writing anything (I had to work during the week and also had that awful trip) I am getting back to my studies, and I am motivated. Since I got back I studied Linear Algebra, Computing Systems and some C. Let's do it!!


### Oct 19th, 2023:

Today I practiced a lot of C. I have some assignments to complete and I am struggling a lot, not gonna lie. However, the good thing is, I think I have improced my problem-solving skills at least a little. Let's keep going!


### Oct 23rd, 2023:

I have been doing the same, practicing Linear Algebra, doing some C programming assignments and so on, but I need to learn a little bit more about Computer Systems and Multimedia because I have not studied much about those subjects..


### Oct 24th, 2023:

Today I am studying a little bit of Ethics and later I am going to study more programming. At Uni, I have to learn recursion one more. It is too complex, but I want to understand this concept..


### Oct 26th, 2023:

I have been trying to make some progress with my skills in C. I feel like I am making some progress at least. I know that I know nothing LOL, but this is how it is, if I really want to achieve something in this field, I have to start from the basics, and this is what I have been doing...


### Oct 30th, 2023:

Another week is starting and I have to practice more Linear Algebra. I am enjoying the C programming part of the course, but linear algebra and computer systems are pretty difficult for me right now...


### Nov 3rd, 2023:

I have already submitted my assignment for Computer Ethics, and I am currently working on the Linear Algebra as well as the Computer Systems one. I am also trying to practice at least a little bit of C programming everyday.


### Nov 7th, 2023:

I am not going to lie... Some times I think about giving up, even though I am just getting started, but that's because I am struggling a lot with math and also because I am having personal problems with my family..


### Nov 10, 2023:

My relationship has officially ended. I know this is not the right place to write about this, but this has impacted my stuides a lot. Although this happened, I managed to learn merge sort and I really enjoyed it. I am also taking a look at binary search right now. Let's do it!!


### Nov 12th, 2023:

Another week is about to begin. I am sending my Linear Algebra assignment as well as the computer systems one... I hope I can get some good grades. May God be with me in this journey. I am now back to studying some C programming, but I had completely forgotten about multimedia systems... I must study a little bit as well...


### Nov 15th, 2023:

I have been mostly practicing C (preparing for my first real assignment), but I also have to keep reading the book about multimedia systems because I already have an assignment to do. Also, I have to get back to Linear Algebra since the next assignment is about some really hard stuff... May God be with me along this journey..


### Nov 19th, 2023:

Another week is about to begin, my goal is to study more C, learn some Linear Algebra and Computer Systems as well.


### Nov 26th, 2023:

This week I will be mostly working on my C assignment which is REALLY difficult. I hope I manage to get a good grade, not because I want a good grade, but because I WANT TO BECOME A FKNG ENGINEER!!!


### Dec 1st, 2023:

I decided to get back to my Web Development studies... I think it will be better if I really focus on skills that can give me job opportunities. As for the university subjects, they will remain important, and they will provide me the Computer Science foundations that I need, but I need to be employable...


## Dec 3rd, 2023:

Another week is about to begin. My goals are to learn a bit more Linear Algebra, learn more C and also study for other subjects. As for my web development studies, I am still revising some CSS, and as soon as I am done, I will practice creating some static websites. I intend to finish revising CSS this week!!!


## Dec 6th, 2023:

Well, it's my birthday, but I still want to code! I am going to achieve this dream!! Today I started to learn the basics of C structures, memory management, pointers and some other interesting stuff!!!


## Dec 11th, 2023:

Another week has begun. This week I plan to finish reviewing CSS and begin practicing with some projects. Aside from that, I will also study C...


## Dec 14th, 2023:

So I have finished "reviewing" some CSS. Right now I am working on a simple C project for a shopping list as well as on the "Simply Recipes" project made by John Smilga. My goal is to become a little more comfortable with CSS (especially regarding the media queries) and after that, I will probably try to work on some web pages in order to really get the hang of it...


## Dec 16th, 2023:

The weekend is arriving. The week was good when it comes to my studies. I could learn more Linear Algebra, learned a bit more of C by building a simple project. I have also finished reviewing CSS basics and right now I am following a tutorial project.


## Dec 18th, 2023:

I have decided to start practicing with some projects rather than just watching tutorials (for the front-end) so I am using HTML and CSS to create some static pages, as for the back-end, I am going to watch a tutorial to learn Java, which will be my choice for the backend


## Dec 21th, 2023:

I have started learning Java for real now, and it looks super cool! I cannot wait to have a good grasp of the basics in order to start creating my first real programs!!!


## Dec 24th, 2023:

It's almost Christmas, but I still want to code... I will soon set me goals/roadmap for the next year!!!


## Dec 28th, 2023:

We are heading towards the end of the year. Although I have not achieved everything I wanted to achieve, I am happy with some of the progress that I've made. I have come to realise that not only in programming, but in life in general, we cannot have everything at once. Now, this is a Software Engineer Diary, so it does not really make sense to talk about stuff that's not related to Software Engineering or CS, but it is impossible to say that my studies/career are not affected by my personal life. I have not had time to create a proper plan for 2024, but I will come up with one soon!!


## January 1st, 2024:

As expected, in my SWE diary, there will only be goals related to Computer Science and Software Engineering. My goals for the year are:

1. Getting comfortable with different programming paradigms, especially OOP.
2. Learning important Data Structures and Algorithms.
3. Learning the basics of backend web development and getting some knowledge in the front-end.
4. Create at least one "nice" project


## January 2nd, 2024:

I have started learning some DSA through coursera free DSA course. Unfortunately though, I will not be able to focus too much on it right now because I have some university stuff I need to do first.


## January 4th, 2024:

Unfortunately, I need to take a break from programming for a while because I have some assignments related to other subjects to submit within the next weeks. I will code as much as possible though. I also have to get back to some C coding since I will have an assignment soon.


## January 4th, 2024:

I have already "finished" my Linear Algebra, Ethics and Multimedia Systems assignments. I only need to finish Computer Systems and wait for IP now.
