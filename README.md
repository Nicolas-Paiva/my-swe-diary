# My Software Engineer diary

Here I will describe everything I study and do in order to become a better software engineer. The goal is to look back and see how much I have improved



#### Sep 07th, 2023:

Currently learning C. I am struggling with pointers right now. I understand what they do and what they are, but it is confusing to understand when to use them and how to use them properly. For now, i am trying to implement some basic functions using them.

As for other subjects, I am learning some "Computer Systems" which is related to the architecture of computers and how they work.

Linear Algebra is also another subject I am currently studying. Learning matrices for now



#### Sep 12th, 2023:

I could not really write here since the last time because my life is  a little busy right now. I have been studying mostly C (pointers are really hard to understand, but I am gonna understand it!), Computer Systems and Linear Algebra. I have not found material for Ethics and Multimedia Systems. As soon as I have some resources I will study them as well. 



#### Sep 21st, 2023:

I could not really focus recently because of some problems... But I think things are finally getting better, and soon I will be able to study properly. I tried to understand "recursion" but it's a concept that I will need a long time to understand and be comfortable with



#### Sep 24th, 2023:

Sadly I could not really study for the last 10 days or so. I need to work a little bit more, but in October things will get back to normal. Hopefully I will understand more about programming as well as linear algebra and computer systems



#### Sep 25th, 2023:

Getting back to my studies... Felt super sleepy today and could not study as much as I wanted, but ended up learning some linear algebra (determinants and their properties) and I am also starting to learn about file handling in C...


### Oct 17th, 2023:

After a while without writing anything (I had to work during the week and also had that awful trip) I am getting back to my studies, and I am motivated. Since I got back I studied Linear Algebra, Computing Systems and some C. Let's do it!!


### Oct 19th, 2023:

Today I practiced a lot of C. I have some assignments to complete and I am struggling a lot, not gonna lie. However, the good thing is, I think I have improced my problem-solving skills at least a little. Let's keep going!


### Oct 23rd, 2023:

I have been doing the same, practicing Linear Algebra, doing some C programming assignments and so on, but I need to learn a little bit more about Computer Systems and Multimedia because I have not studied much about those subjects..


### Oct 24th, 2023:

Today I am studying a little bit of Ethics and later I am going to study more programming. At Uni, I have to learn recursion one more. It is too complex, but I want to understand this concept.


### Oct 26th, 2023:

I have been trying to make some progress with my skills in C. I feel like I am making some progress at least. I know that I know nothing LOL, but this is how it is, if I really want to achieve something in this field, I have to start from the basics, and this is what I have been doing.
