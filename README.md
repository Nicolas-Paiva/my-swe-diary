Currently learning C. I am struggling with pointers right now. I understand what they do and what, but it is confusing to understand when to use them and how to use them properly. For now, i am trying to implement some basic functions using them.

As for other subjects, I am learning some "Computer Systems" which is related to the architecture of computers and how they work.

Linear Algebra is also another subject I am currently studying. Learning matrices for now.
