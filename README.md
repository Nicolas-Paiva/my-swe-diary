# My Software Engineer diary

Here I will describe everything I study and do in order to become a better software engineer. The goal is to look back and see how much I have improved...


#### Sep 07th, 2023:

Currently learning C. I am struggling with pointers right now. I understand what they do and what they are, but it is confusing to understand when to use them and how to use them properly. For now, i am trying to implement some basic functions using them.

As for other subjects, I am learning some "Computer Systems" which is related to the architecture of computers and how they work.

Linear Algebra is also another subject I am currently studying. Learning matrices for now


#### Sep 12th, 2023:

I could not really write here since the last time because my life is  a little busy right now. I have been studying mostly C (pointers are really hard to understand, but I am gonna understand it!), Computer Systems and Linear Algebra. I have not found material for Ethics and Multimedia Systems. As soon as I have some resources I will study them as well. 


#### Sep 21st, 2023:

I could not really focus recently because of some problems... But I think things are finally getting better, and soon I will be able to study properly. I tried to understand "recursion" but it's a concept that I will need a long time to understand and be comfortable with


#### Sep 24th, 2023:

Sadly I could not really study for the last 10 days or so. I need to work a little bit more, but in October things will get back to normal. Hopefully I will understand more about programming as well as linear algebra and computer systems


#### Sep 25th, 2023:

Getting back to my studies... Felt super sleepy today and could not study as much as I wanted, but ended up learning some linear algebra (determinants and their properties) and I am also starting to learn about file handling in C...


### Oct 17th, 2023:

After a while without writing anything (I had to work during the week and also had that awful trip) I am getting back to my studies, and I am motivated. Since I got back I studied Linear Algebra, Computing Systems and some C. Let's do it!!


### Oct 19th, 2023:

Today I practiced a lot of C. I have some assignments to complete and I am struggling a lot, not gonna lie. However, the good thing is, I think I have improced my problem-solving skills at least a little. Let's keep going!


### Oct 23rd, 2023:

I have been doing the same, practicing Linear Algebra, doing some C programming assignments and so on, but I need to learn a little bit more about Computer Systems and Multimedia because I have not studied much about those subjects..


### Oct 24th, 2023:

Today I am studying a little bit of Ethics and later I am going to study more programming. At Uni, I have to learn recursion one more. It is too complex, but I want to understand this concept..


### Oct 26th, 2023:

I have been trying to make some progress with my skills in C. I feel like I am making some progress at least. I know that I know nothing LOL, but this is how it is, if I really want to achieve something in this field, I have to start from the basics, and this is what I have been doing...


### Oct 30th, 2023:

Another week is starting and I have to practice more Linear Algebra. I am enjoying the C programming part of the course, but linear algebra and computer systems are pretty difficult for me right now...


### Nov 3rd, 2023:

I have already submitted my assignment for Computer Ethics, and I am currently working on the Linear Algebra as well as the Computer Systems one. I am also trying to practice at least a little bit of C programming everyday.


### Nov 7th, 2023:

I am not going to lie... Some times I think about giving up, even though I am just getting started, but that's because I am struggling a lot with math and also because I am having personal problems with my family..


### Nov 10, 2023:

My relationship has officially ended. I know this is not the right place to write about this, but this has impacted my stuides a lot. Although this happened, I managed to learn merge sort and I really enjoyed it. I am also taking a look at binary search right now. Let's do it!!


### Nov 12th, 2023:

Another week is about to begin. I am sending my Linear Algebra assignment as well as the computer systems one... I hope I can get some good grades. May God be with me in this journey. I am now back to studying some C programming, but I had completely forgotten about multimedia systems... I must study a little bit as well...


### Nov 15th, 2023:

I have been mostly practicing C (preparing for my first real assignment), but I also have to keep reading the book about multimedia systems because I already have an assignment to do. Also, I have to get back to Linear Algebra since the next assignment is about some really hard stuff... May God be with me along this journey..


### Nov 19th, 2023:

Another week is about to begin, my goal is to study more C, learn some Linear Algebra and Computer Systems as well.


### Nov 26th, 2023:

This week I will be mostly working on my C assignment which is REALLY difficult. I hope I manage to get a good grade, not because I want a good grade, but because I WANT TO BECOME A FKNG ENGINEER!!!


### Dec 1st, 2023:

I decided to get back to my Web Development studies... I think it will be better if I really focus on skills that can give me job opportunities. As for the university subjects, they will remain important, and they will provide me the Computer Science foundations that I need, but I need to be employable...


## Dec 3rd, 2023:

Another week is about to begin. My goals are to learn a bit more Linear Algebra, learn more C and also study for other subjects. As for my web development studies, I am still revising some CSS, and as soon as I am done, I will practice creating some static websites. I intend to finish revising CSS this week!!!


## Dec 6th, 2023:

Well, it's my birthday, but I still want to code! I am going to achieve this dream!! Today I started to learn the basics of C structures, memory management, pointers and some other interesting stuff!!!

## Dec 11th, 2023:

Another week has begun. This week I plan to finish reviewing CSS and begin practicing with some projects. Aside from that, I will also study C...

## Dec 14th, 2023:

So I have finished "reviewing" some CSS. Right now I am working on a simple C project for a shopping list as well as on the "Simply Recipes" project made by John Smilga. My goal is to become a little more comfortable with CSS (especially regarding the media queries) and after that, I will probably try to work on some web pages in order to really get the hang of it...

## Dec 16th, 2023:

The weekend is arriving. The week was good when it comes to my studies. I could learn more Linear Algebra, learned a bit more of C by building a simple project. I have also finished reviewing CSS basics and right now I am following a tutorial project.

## Dec 18th, 2023:

I will be finishing the tutorial project this week, so I am also going to start applying the skills I acquired. After some months practicing CSS I will probably learn JS or Java.
